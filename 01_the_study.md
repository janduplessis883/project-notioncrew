# 01-the-study - Study: CN012-0023

## Study Overview and Objectives
The study, titled CN012-0023, is a Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study evaluating the safety and efficacy of KarXT for the treatment of agitation associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The primary objective is to measure the efficacy of KarXT compared to placebo using the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI).

## Study Design
This clinical trial is designed as a multicenter, international study consisting of a 30-day Screening Period, a 14-week Double-blind Treatment Period, and a Safety Follow-up visit two weeks after the end of treatment. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either KarXT or placebo.

## Investigational Product and Route of Delivery
- **Name**: KarXT (BMS-986510)
- **Route of Administration**: Oral 

## Randomisation Requirements
This study is double-blind; hence, extra staff may be required to ensure blinding. Appropriate training will be needed for staff administering treatments and for conducting assessments.

## Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
### Inclusion Criteria
- Aged 55 to 90 years.
- Significant caregiver involvement (10 hours/week).
- Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's Disease based on NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.
- NPI-NH Agitation/Aggression Score of ≥ 4.
- CGI-S score ≥ 4 at screening.
  
### Exclusion Criteria
- Agitation primarily due to conditions other than Alzheimer’s Disease.
- History of significant medical conditions or certain psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia).
- Any history of hyper-sensitivity to KarXT excipients.

## Resource and Staffing Requirements
- Trained clinical staff for administering the study protocol.
- Facilities for assessments involving various cognitive scales and ECGs.
- Staffing for participant recruitment and management.

## Recruitment Strategies
Recruitment will primarily occur through hospitals and primary care settings. Investigators may leverage existing relationships within the Alzheimer's community to identify eligible patients, with target recruitment sites distributed across the UK.

## Timeline and Milestone Breakdown
- **Site Selection Finalisation**: By 20/01/2025
- **First Participant First Visit (FPFV)**: 01/07/2025
- **Last Participant First Visit (LPFV)**: 01/11/2027
- **Last Participant Last Visit (LPLV)**: 30/04/2028

## Identified Risks or Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
- **Challenge**: Recruitment may be limited due to the specificity of the patient population.
  - **Mitigation**: Engage with diverse recruitment sites and ongoing communication to adapt strategies.
  
- **Challenge**: Ensuring blinding integrity.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement strict protocols for the administration of treatment and monitoring.

## Additional Questions from the Sponsor
1. In your experience, where are these patients usually seen? Keen to know % of patients being seen in GP care, versus hospital or memory clinics etc.
2. Are there any privacy concerns around audio/video recordings of assessment/rater scales being taken via an official tablet during visits?
3. What percentage of patients with AD Agitation have a caregiver that sees the patients a minimum of 10 hours per week and would be able to accompany patients to study visits?
4. Would your facilities allow for a private room to be available for the length of the visit including a carer being present to accompany the participant on their visits?
