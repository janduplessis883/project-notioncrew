# 01-the-study - Study: CN012-0023

## Study Overview and Objectives
This study is a Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of KarXT in participants with agitation associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of KarXT compared with placebo as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI).

## Study Design
The study is designed as a multicenter, global trial with two treatment groups (KarXT and placebo) randomized in a 1:1 ratio. There will be a 30-day Screening Period, followed by a 14-week Double-Blind Treatment Period and a Safety Follow-up visit two weeks after the end of treatment.

## Investigational Product and Route of Delivery
- **Investigational Product**: KarXT (BMS-986510)
- **Route of Administration**: Oral

## Randomisation Requirements
The study will be double-blind; therefore, extra staffing may be required for the blinding procedures and for ensuring compliance with the randomization protocols.

## Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

### Inclusion Criteria:
- Aged 55 to 90 years.
- Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease.
- Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 5 to 22.
- History of agitation with onset at least two weeks prior to screening.
- Agitation/Aggression score ≥ 4 at Screening and Baseline.

### Exclusion Criteria:
- Agitation symptoms primarily due to conditions other than AD.
- Major depressive episodes, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia history.
- Significant medical conditions that could jeopardize the study outcomes.

## Resource and Staffing Requirements
- Trained staff familiar with rating scales (e.g., CMAI, MMSE, NPI-NH).
- ECG capabilities.
- Research nurses and coordinators to manage participant enrollment and follow-up visits.

## Recruitment Strategies
- Targeting participants from hospitals, primary care settings, and memory clinics.
- Preliminary inquiries into the feasibility and experience of potential sites.

## Timeline and Milestone Breakdown
- **Site selection finalization**: 20/01/2025
- **First Participant First Visit (FPFV)**: 01/07/2025
- **Last Participant Last Visit (LPLV)**: 30/04/2028

## Identified Risks or Challenges
- **Recruitment Challenges**: Low patient turnout due to eligibility strictness.
  - **Mitigation**: Engage with multiple sites to maximize recruitment potential and leverage existing patient databases.

## Additional Questions Asked by the Sponsor
1. In your experience, where do moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease patients usually get seen? Please specify the percentage seen in GP care versus hospital or memory clinics.
2. Are there privacy concerns regarding audio/video recordings taken during assessments through an official tablet?
3. What percentage of patients with agitation have a caregiver who can accompany them to study visits?
4. Will private rooms be available for visits, allowing for a caregiver’s presence?
