# Study Overview and Objectives
## Full Study Title
CN012-0023: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of KarXT for the Treatment of Agitation Associated with Alzheimer’s Disease

## Study Objectives
- **Primary Objective**: Evaluate the efficacy of KarXT compared to placebo in treating agitation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI).
- **Secondary Objectives**: Assess additional efficacy measures related to agitation and evaluate the safety and tolerability of KarXT.

# Study Design
- Phase: Phase 3
- Type: Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-Center Study
- Target Population: Participants with agitation associated with AD.
- Treatment Groups: 710 participants anticipated (320 randomized per study), 1:1 allocation to KarXT or placebo.

# Investigational Product and Route of Delivery
- **Name**: BMS-986510 (KarXT)
- **Route of Delivery**: Oral administration.

# Randomization Requirements
- The study will be double-blind and requires extra staff for blinding procedures and randomization management.

- History of agitation with onset at least two weeks prior to screening

## Exclusion Criteria
- Symptoms attributable to a condition other than AD
- Severe medical conditions impacting safety or compliance 
- History of major depressive episodes, bipolar disorder, or significant heart conditions

# Resource and Staffing Requirements
