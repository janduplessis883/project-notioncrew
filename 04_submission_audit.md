# 04-submission-audit - Study: {study_identifier}

## Overall Score: 7/10

### Areas Requiring Improvement:

1. **Participant Identification**:
   - Lacks detail on specific systems used for EHR and a comparison of practice list size with local practices.
   - Missing ethnic breakdown of the patient population.

2. **Recruitment Methods**:
   - No expected response rates outlined for recruitment methods.
   - Missing a clear "Plan B" strategy for recruitment.

3. **Staff Resources and Capabilities**:
   - Lack of specificity regarding the training and GCP qualifications of support staff.
   - Roles and responsibilities are not explicitly defined.

4. **Site Infrastructure and Equipment**:
   - Absence of clear information regarding dedicated research space and an on-site pharmacy.

5. **Site-Specific Activities**:
   - No mention of possible future resource constraints despite stating no conflicts with ongoing studies.

6. **Site Past Performance Data**:
   - Past performance metrics should be supplemented with clear recruitment timelines and details.

7. **Contract Review**:
   - Missing timelines for review of contracts or CDAs which are crucial to sponsors.

### Suggested Updates/Actions:
- Include comprehensive detail on the specifics of the Electronic Health Records used, alongside comparisons to other practices in the area.
- Provide a breakdown of the ethnic diversity within the patient population to enhance inclusivity considerations.
- Clearly outline expected response rates for SMS/text recruitment and detail any fallback strategies if initial recruitment plans are not successful.
- Enhance the descriptions around staff capabilities by specifying training levels and roles more explicitly.
- Clarify available infrastructure by explicitly stating dedicated spaces for research and confirming the availability of pharmacy services on-site.
- Elaborate on possible future competing studies that could influence recruitment capabilities.
- Add recruitment figures and timelines from past studies to strengthen the site's historical performance.
- Ensure that timelines for contract reviews and CDA processes are included to facilitate smoother interactions with sponsors.
