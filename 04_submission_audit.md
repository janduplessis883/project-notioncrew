# 04-submission-audit - Study: {study_identifier}

## Overall Score
**Score: 7/10**

## Areas Requiring Improvement

1. **Participant Recruitment Section**:
   - **Detail Missing**: The section on participant recruitment lacks specific data about demographic diversity. The guidelines emphasize the importance of including the ethnic breakdown of the patient population to showcase the site's commitment to diversity. 
   - **Suggested Action**: Include a clear breakdown of the ethnic composition of the patient population, as well as any efforts made to engage underrepresented groups in research.

2. **Challenges in Recruitment**:
   - **Clarity Needed**: The response lists potential challenges, but it's vague and could benefit from a more structured format. It should explicitly categorize challenges faced (e.g., language barriers, cultural apprehensions) and their potential impact on recruitment.
   - **Suggested Action**: Reformat this section to categorize and elaborate on each identified challenge. Include mitigation strategies for high-priority challenges.

3. **Staff Experience and Capabilities**:
   - **Detail Missing**: There is insufficient emphasis on the staff's specific training related to the study's requirements. The guidelines recommend discussing GCP training and any relevant previous research experience in more detail.
   - **Suggested Action**: Provide detailed qualifications of all involved staff, particularly emphasizing their training and direct experience with similar study protocols.

4. **Site Infrastructure**:
   - **Incompleteness**: While useful equipment is mentioned, there is no mention of the availability of dedicated research space or pharmacy resources, which are critical for facilitating study activities.
   - **Suggested Action**: Clearly specify the availability of research facilities, including the number of rooms allocated for study visits and procedures as per the guidelines.

5. **Past Performance Data**:
   - **Data Lacking**: The section on past recruitment performance lacks quantitative data. The guidelines indicate that specific recruitment figures from similar studies should be referenced to provide context and show capability.
   - **Suggested Action**: Include clear numerical performance data from past studies, highlighting the total number recruited and the average recruitment timeline for context.

## Conclusion
To enhance the submission's effectiveness, the Site Identification Questionnaire should be revised to address these gaps, focusing on demographic diversity, structured problems and solutions, detailed staffing qualifications, infrastructure specifics, and robust past performance metrics. These adjustments will align the questionnaire with the guidelines and strengthen the proposal's overall impact.
