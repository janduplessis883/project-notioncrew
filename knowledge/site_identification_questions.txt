Where and how will participants be identified at the research site?
Site Demographic

Do you anticipate any challenges that may affect recruitment of this patient population?
Located in the heart of Chelsea, The Chelsea Practice (TCP) offers an agile, patient-centric, and highly experienced environment for both commercial and non-commercial clinical research. We pride ourselves on rapid decision-making, extensive community engagement, and a history of meeting (and often exceeding) recruitment targets—even under challenging circumstances.

1. Infrastructure & Accessibility
	1.	Central Location & Transport
	•	Situated in Chelsea with excellent public transport links (buses, tube stations) and off-street parking options, ensuring easy access for participants.
	2.	Wheelchair & Disability Access
	•	The practice provides wheelchair access and mobility-friendly facilities to accommodate diverse patient needs.
	3.	Flexible Scheduling
	•	A small, dedicated core team can quickly reorganize routine clinical work to meet the demands of time-sensitive research activities.

2. Patient Population & Recruitment Strategy

2.1 Patient Demographics
	•	Total Patient Population at The Chelsea Practice: 6,500
	•	Primary Care Network (PCN): Brompton Health PCN serves 140,000 patients

	•	Ethnicity (Recorded in EHR: 93%)
	•	Non-BAME: 69%

2.3 Participant Identification
	1.	Electronic Health Records (EHR)
	•	The site uses SystmOne to identify potential participants through tailored searches matching study-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.
	•	A data-validation step ensures final pre-screen lists are accurate and relevant.
	2.	Personalized Patient Review
	•	Dr. Scudder—who knows her patient population intimately—reviews each pre-screen list before contact, ensuring only suitable participants are approached.
	3.	Sister Practice: Earls Court Surgery
	•	With a combined 10,000 patients, Earls Court Surgery collaborates formally with TCP. Patients identified in Earls Court remain under Dr. Scudder’s clinical oversight for research.
	4.	Brompton Health PCN
	•	Serving 140,000 patients, Brompton Health PCN can function as a Participant Identification Centre (PIC), enabling rapid scaling of recruitment efforts.

2.4 Community Engagement & Outreach

To enhance recruitment—particularly among NIHR under-served groups—The Chelsea Practice implements a robust, multifaceted community engagement strategy:
	1.	Informational Sessions
	•	Regular sessions within the local community, explaining the study purpose, procedures, benefits, and eligibility criteria.
	2.	Neighborhood Navigators
	•	Staff under the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme (ARRS) within our PCN actively reach out to diverse community members, building trust and facilitating communication.
	3.	Targeted Outreach
	•	Highlighting minority groups during EHR reviews and collaborating with Neighborhood Navigators and the PCN Community Corner to ensure inclusive, tailored recruitment approaches.

3. Potential Challenges in Recruitment
	1.	Disease Severity & Patient Availability
	•	Advanced disease stages may limit patient mobility and ability to attend frequent visits.
	•	Comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes) may complicate eligibility and study consistency.
	2.	Treatment Burden & Compliance
	•	Subcutaneous Administration: Patients may be apprehensive about injections or potential side effects.
	•	Complex Regimens: Polypharmacy and drug interactions can deter patients from joining or continuing a trial.
	3.	Recruitment & Retention
	•	Patient Awareness: Requires effective communication, outreach, and education.
	•	Retention: Ongoing engagement is vital for consistent follow-up, especially if participants experience side effects or logistical barriers.
	4.	Socioeconomic & Demographic Factors
	•	Accessibility: Lack of transportation or financial resources can limit participation.
	•	Diverse Populations: Tailored approaches are required to reach minority groups who may have varying levels of trust in clinical research.
	5.	Regulatory & Ethical Considerations
	•	Informed Consent: Ensuring participants understand investigational product implications is crucial, particularly for those with low health literacy.

4. Strategies to Overcome Challenges
	1.	Enhanced Patient Education & Support
	•	Provide clear, accessible information about the study and investigational product.
	•	Offer home visits for eligible patients to alleviate concerns about subcutaneous administration.
	2.	Community Engagement & Outreach
	•	Leverage local advocacy groups and the PCN’s community networks to increase awareness.
	•	Use Neighborhood Navigators and the PCN Community Corner to reach underrepresented groups.
	3.	Flexible Study Design
	•	Consider flexible scheduling and/or home visits to accommodate patients with mobility or scheduling constraints.
	4.	Incentives & Reimbursement
	•	Offer travel reimbursements, stipends, or other incentives to reduce financial barriers.
