### Participant recruitment
**Where and how will participants be identified at the research site?**  
Participants will be identified through multiple avenues:
1. **Electronic Health Records (EHR):** The site utilizes SystmOne to conduct tailored searches to match study-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.
2. **Personalized Patient Review:** Dr. Scudder will personally review each pre-screen list to ensure suitability.
3. **Sister Practice Collaboration:** The site collaborates with Earls Court Surgery, expanding potential participant reach through a combined patient population of 10,000.
4. **Community Engagement:** Regular informational sessions and outreach conducted by staff to raise awareness and provide insights into the study.

### Site Demographic
Total Patient Population:
- The Chelsea Practice: **6,500 patients**

- **Ethnicity Data:** Non-BAME: **69%**, BAME (Total): **31%** (including Chinese: 13.6%, Asian: 7.4%, Black: 6.5%, Mixed: 3.4%)

### Do you anticipate any challenges that may affect recruitment of this patient population?  
1. **Disease Severity & Patient Availability:** Advanced stages may limit participation.
2. **Patient Compliance Concerns:** Potential apprehension around treatment burdens.
3. **Socioeconomic Factors:** Accessibility issues impacting participation.
