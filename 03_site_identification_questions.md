## Participant recruitment

### Where and how will participants be identified at the research site?
Participants will be identified utilizing electronic health records (EHR) through tailored searches matching the study's specific inclusion/exclusion criteria using SystmOne. A personalized review of each pre-screen list will be conducted by Dr. Scudder, ensuring accurate recruitment from a patient population of over 6,500 at The Chelsea Practice.

### Do you anticipate any challenges that may affect recruitment of this patient population?
The Chelsea Practice, located in Chelsea, has a history of rapid decision-making and extensive community engagement. However, potential challenges include:
1. Disease severity affecting patient mobility.
2. Comorbidities that complicate eligibility.
3. Treatment burden and patient apprehension towards participation.
4. Accessibility issues, particularly for underrepresented groups.
5. Regulatory and ethical considerations in obtaining informed consent.

### Based on all the considerations outlined above and the information available at the time, please provide a realistic estimation of numbers of potential recruits by the end of the proposed recruitment period, including workings.
1. How many patients in this setting will be seen with this condition?
   - Approximately 200 patients seen annually with the specific condition aligned with the study objectives.
   
2. Using the exclusion criteria, how many of these patients would be eligible to take part in this study?
   - An estimated 100 patients would meet the inclusion criteria after applying the exclusion factors.

3. What percentage of these would you expect will be motivated to take part?
   - Assuming a 50% motivation rate, around 50 patients would likely express interest in participating.

4. Considering the answers above, how many recruits would you anticipate over the time period?
   - With the projected recruitment timeframe of 6 months, an estimated recruitment of 30 patients is anticipated.

5. Planned recruitment strategy:
   - The recruitment strategy includes community engagement, digital outreach via social media, educational presentations, and direct identification through EHR. 

### Please outline any ongoing or planned studies at the research site which may compete with or impact recruitment to the study.
Currently, there are no conflicting recruiting studies; a CKD study was recently completed.
