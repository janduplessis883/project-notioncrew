## Site Contact Information
Research site: The Chelsea Practice E87750  
Investigator: Dr Claire Scudder, claire.scudder@nhs.net, 07855331091  
Main contact for feasibility discussions: Dr Jan du Plessis, jan.duplessis@nhs.net, 07486321744  

## Participant recruitment
### Where and how will participants be identified at the research site?
The Chelsea Practice (TCP) has a total patient population of approximately 6,500, which can be supplemented by the neighboring Earls Court Surgery with an additional 10,000 patients. 

Potential participants will be identified primarily through:
1. **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: Utilization of SystmOne to filter patients matching study-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.
2. **Staff Review**: Personal review of pre-screen lists by Dr. Scudder to ensure suitable candidates are contacted.
3. **Community Outreach**: Engaging with the Brompton Health Primary Care Network (PCN) which serves 140,000 patients for broader participant identification.

### Do you anticipate any challenges that may affect recruitment of this patient population?
- **Disease Severity & Patient Availability**: Advanced stages of disease may deter participation due to mobility issues.
- **Treatment Burden**: Concerns regarding subcutaneous administration and complex medication regimens may reduce recruitment.
- **Regulatory & Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring informed consent, especially among participants with lower health literacy.

## Recruitment Strategies
### Please provide a detailed overview of your recruitment strategies.
1. **Understanding the Patient Population**: Surveys to gauge interest in trials and emphasizing benefits of trial products.
2. **Healthcare Provider Outreach**: Informational material to providers for patient referrals.
3. **Collaboration with Patient Advocacy Groups**: Engaging with local organizations to increase trust and outreach.
4. **Digital Recruitment Campaigns**: Targeted social media ads to attract qualified participants.
5. **Localized Lab Services**: Minimizing barriers by providing lab services locally.
6. **Engaging Interested Patients**: Contacting individuals already in our databases who may fit the study criteria.
7. **Automated Follow-up Services**: Use of automated reminders for potential participants.
8. **Retention-Focused Recruitment**: Strategies in place to ensure participant satisfaction and retention throughout the study.

### Timelines and Milestones
- **Study Start Date**: TBD
- **Recruitment Period**: 6 months
- **Data Collection**: 3 months
- **Final Analysis**: TBD
- **Study Completion**: TBD

## Expected Recruitment:
### 1. How many patients in this setting will be seen with this condition?
Based on current population data and disease prevalence, an estimated 50 patients with the relevant conditions can be approached.

### 2. Using the exclusion criteria, how many of these patients would be eligible to take part in this study?
Considering exclusion criteria, approximately 30 patients are expected to be eligible.

### 3. What percentage of these would you expect will be motivated to take part?
We anticipate approximately 40% motivation to enroll, leading to about 12 participants.

### 4. How many recruits would you anticipate over the time period?
Given the recruitment strategies and the above estimates, we project about 12 participants can be successfully recruited within the six-month period.

### Planned Recruitment Strategy:
Recruitment will leverage both existing databases and new outreach efforts emphasizing education about the investigational product to enhance motivation and understanding.

### Please outline any ongoing or planned studies at the research site which may compete with or impact recruitment to the study.
Currently, there are no conflicting studies affecting recruitment efforts.
