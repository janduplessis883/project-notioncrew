## Detailed Recruitment Strategy

### Overview
This recruitment strategy aims to effectively recruit participants for the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of KarXT in individuals with agitation associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The strategy leverages both traditional recruitment methodologies and innovative technology to overcome anticipated challenges.

### Target Population
- Individuals aged 55 to 90 years.
- Diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease.
- A Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 5 to 22.
- Exhibiting agitation/aggression scores ≥ 4 at Screening and Baseline.

### Recruitment Methods

1. **Clinical Outreach:**
   - **Primary Care Providers:** Engage general practitioners and specialists who treat Alzheimer's patients. Inform them about the trial and provide them with informational materials to share with potential participants.
   - **Memory Clinics and Hospitals:** Establish partnerships with memory clinics and hospitals known to manage Alzheimer’s patients. Conduct presentations to staff and distribute flyers.

2. **Utilization of TrialMatch:**
   - Leverage the Alzheimer's Association's TrialMatch program to connect individuals with ongoing research studies applicable to their condition. Promote this resource to both healthcare providers and potential participants.
   
3. **Community Engagement:**
   - **Support Groups:** Engage local Alzheimer's support groups and caregiver organizations to spread the word about the trial.
   - **Public Seminars:** Organize informational seminars in community centers focusing on Alzheimer's disease, where potential participants can learn about the study.

4. **Digital Recruitment Strategies:**
   - Implement targeted advertisements on social media platforms focusing on Alzheimer’s disease awareness. Utilize patient databases to send personalized letters inviting eligible patients to participate in the study.
   - Employ interactive response technology (IRT) to manage and streamline patient enrollment and randomization.

### Timeline and Milestones
- **Site Selection Finalization:** 20/01/2025
- **Kick-off Meeting with Partners and Providers:** 01/03/2025

### Resources Required
- Research nurses and coordinators to manage enrollment and follow-up visits.
- Training sessions for clinic staff to familiarize them with trial requirements.
- Marketing materials and digital advertising budget.
- Access to TrialMatch and other relevant databases.

### Plan B for Delays in Recruitment
If recruitment is lagging behind schedule:
- Increase the number of participating sites to maximize outreach.
- Reassess and strengthen engagement with existing outreach partners.
- Offer incentives for participation, such as travel reimbursement or access to study findings.
- Utilize qualitative research to identify specific barriers potential participants face and address these directly.

### Conclusion
This recruitment strategy is designed to tap into various resources and methods to ensure the recruitment of eligible participants for the CN012-0023 study. It is essential to monitor the recruitment process closely and adapt the strategies as necessary to achieve enrollment targets.
